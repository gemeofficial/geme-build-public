# Second Life Demo

This is a component DEMO copied from [compost site](https://compost.recyc-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/#les-resultats).

It contains files:

- `compost-site-entry.css`: is downloaded from [the site's `entry.{hash}.css`](https://compost.recyc-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/_nuxt/entry.85651471.css). It contains the site's main stylesheet.
- `second-life-demo.css`: is only copied the necessary styles used by the `<SecondLifeDemo>` component.
- `second-life-demo.tsx`: is the demo component which is the source of the `<SecondLifeDemo>`. GEME.bio could copy this file and modify it to customize text and styles.
