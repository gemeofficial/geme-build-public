  section1Description: (
    <>
      GEME-Kobold is the world's sole known high-temperature resistant composite
      microbiota, an ancient community with decades of evolutionary success. It
      is not an artificially developed microbe but a practitioner of natural
      circulation law.
    </>

  section2Title: 'Unique In The World',
  section2Description: (
    <>
      In the high-efficiency biological waste processor's circulation system,
      bio-waste undergoes rapid heating to 75â„ƒ, fermenting and drying with
      GEME-Kobold's action.
      <br />
      <br />
      This aerobic high-temperature exposure kills potential pathogens and
      neutralizes the harmfulness of fermenting products.
    </>
  ),
  section3Title: 'Complex Microbiota',
  section3Description: (
    <>
      GEME-Kobold significantly contributes to organic matter recycling. It
      comprises 46 complex, heat-tolerant aerobic bacillus bacteria.
      <br />
      <br />
      Within 6-8 hours, it can decompose various bio-wastes, producing
      high-activity organic fertilizer. It also activates soil and water
      microorganisms, rejuvenating them.
