          Angelita live in Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½, she contact us in April and bought one
          unit. At that time we were not able to ship from US to Mexico.
          However, her Angelita run a truck company. She easily ship our unit
          from Texas to Mexico easily. After months of daily using, she decide
          to purchase 3 more for her daughter's Christmas gift. BTW, she is also
          a hero help to one of our Kickstarter solve our fulfillment to Mexico.
