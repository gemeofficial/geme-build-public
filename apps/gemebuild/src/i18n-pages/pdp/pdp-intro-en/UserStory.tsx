          Mexican customer Angelita (contacted April) bought a unit despite our
          initial US-Mexico shipping hurdle. Her trucking company facilitated
          Texas pick-up. Loving the product, she purchased 3 more for her
          daughters' Christmas! Angelita even became a hero by helping us
          resolve a fulfillment issue for another Mexico Kickstarter campaign.

          and reducing carbon footprint. Following GEME since its July 2022
          crowdfunding campaign, he secured a â‚¬499 unit via installments and
          actively promoted GEME's product and vision to his network. A true
          sustainability champion!
